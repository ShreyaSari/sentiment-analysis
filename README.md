Overview
Sentiment analysis on Twitter data involves using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and classify tweets into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. This helps in understanding public opinion, brand perception, and emerging social trends.

Key Steps in Sentiment Analysis
Data Collection

Scraping tweets using Twitter API or Kaggle datasets.
Filtering tweets based on hashtags, keywords, or user accounts.
Data Preprocessing

Removing stopwords, URLs, special characters, and emojis.
Tokenization: Splitting text into words or phrases.
Lemmatization/Stemming: Reducing words to their root forms.
Feature Engineering

Converting text into numerical format using TF-IDF, Bag of Words, or Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT).
Model Selection & Training

Using Machine Learning models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest.
Applying Deep Learning models like LSTMs, GRUs, or Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa) for more accurate predictions.
Evaluation & Deployment

Evaluating performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deploying the model using Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit for real-time sentiment analysis.
